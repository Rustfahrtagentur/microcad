# Recap

In this tutorial you should have learned about the following things:

- Installing microcad
- Creating a new Âµcad file
- Using basic 2D primitives in `std::geo2d`: `Rect`, `Circle`, `Frame`
- Define and use named values and models
- Combining geometries with `std::ops::subtract` and `std::ops::union`
- Geometrical operators: `|`, `-`
- Using the `use` statement
- Move geometries with `std::ops::translate`
- [Arrays](../../../../doc/types/arrays.md)
- Argument multiplicity
- Ranges
- Constants
- Extruding sketches with `std::ops::extrude`
- Creating custom sketches, parts and operations
- Separating code into external modules
- Controlling export with attributes

Congratulations, you now have successfully finished this tutorial!

If you could not get enough, try to master the additional exercises...
