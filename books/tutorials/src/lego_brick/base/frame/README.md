# Creating the frame

The first geometry we want to construct is the frame of the brick's base.
It consists of an outer and an inner rectangle.

The outer frame is a rectangle with a `width = 31.8mm` and a `height = 15.8mm`.
From that we will derive the inner frame by using `thickness = 1.2mm` as parameter.
