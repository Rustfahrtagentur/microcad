# Matrix types

Matrix types are built-in types and can be defined as:

* `Matrix2`: A 2x2 matrix, commonly used for 2D rotations.
* `Matrix3`: A 3x3 matrix, commonly used for rotations.
* `Matrix4`: A 4x4 matrix, commonly used for affine transformations.


*Note: Currently, matrices are used only internally and cannot be instantiated from Âµcad code.*
